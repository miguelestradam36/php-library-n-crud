# PHP CURD Application for PHP programmers (Initial/Junior version)

This CRUD working example was designed for a local database (In this case a `PHPMyAdmin`), now, if you want to connect this database to an online database or something related the only thing you would have to do would be to change the variables responsable for the connnection.

## Connection to localhost database in this scenario

In this case I am using the app `XAMPP` to run PHP on a Microsoft device.

### Run this program with XAMPP

XAMPP lets you run PHP on Apache servers, this when you do not want to upload the code to the server yet.
